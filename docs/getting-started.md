## Setting up your local development environment

### Pre-requesites

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control)
- Basic understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript#tutorials) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

### Fork the turnbasedgames/tictactoe repository

Navigate to [github.com/turnbasedgames/tictactoe](https://github.com/turnbasedgames/tictactoe) and fork the repository and clone it locally. Then run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should see the Urturn **Runner** at work, which allows you to develop your games locally and offline. You will see the initial server console, with no players in the game yet.
